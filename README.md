# AlphaTrans
This repository contains artifacts of AlphaTrans.

## Getting Started
We provide a [`Dockerfile`](/Dockerfile) which installs all necessary dependencies to reproduce the results of AlphaTrans. Please download [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), and then execute the following to create a docker image and execute the container in interactive mode:

```
docker build --no-cache -t alphatrans .
docker run -it alphatrans bash
```
> [!NOTE]
> If you are using MacOS with an Apple chip, please consider adding `--platform=linux/amd64` in `docker build`.

Please refer to [Reproduce AlphaTrans Results](#reproduce-alphatrans-results) for instructions on how to reproduce the results of AlphaTrans. If you are interested in translating more projects, please refer to [Translate New Java Projects](#translate-new-java-projects).

## Reproduce AlphaTrans Results
AlphaTrans currently supports prompting OpenAI models (e.g., `gpt-4o-2024-11-20`) and open-source models (e.g., `deepseek-ai/deepseek-coder-33b-instruct`) served by [ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama), [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm) or any other engine which can provide an endpoint. We have created a [`model_configs.yaml`](/configs/model_configs.yaml) file to store necessary model information. Please paste in required model information to start experimenting with AlphaTrans.

### RQ1: Effectiveness of AlphaTrans
For all ten projects, we provide the project skeletons and partial translations. Please execute the following to start translating projects (e.g., `commons-fileupload` project with `gpt-4o-2024-11-20` model and with `temperature=0.0`):

```
bash scripts/get_dependencies.sh _decomposed_tests
bash scripts/generate_test_invocation_map.sh _decomposed_tests
bash scripts/extract_coverage.sh commons-fileupload _decomposed_tests
bash scripts/translate_fragment.sh commons-fileupload 0.0 gpt-4o-2024-11-20
```

> [!NOTE]
> Executing the script `extract_coverage.sh` can take some time. Please be patient.

These scripts will translate the project fragment by fragment in reverse-call graph order and store translations in JSON files along with validation results (e.g., syntactical correctness, GraalVM correctness, test execution correctness, etc.). If you want to create standalone python projects, simply recompose all translations with the following script:

```
bash scripts/recompose.sh commons-fileupload 0.0 gpt-4o-2024-11-20
```

If you want to check the effectiveness of `gpt-4o-2024-11-20` in translating `commons-fileupload`, please run the following script:

```
bash scripts/print_results.sh commons-fileupload 0.0 gpt-4o-2024-11-20 data/schemas_decomposed_tests/translations
```

> [!NOTE]
> Due to probabilistic behavior of models, the results might be slightly different when re-translating projects. You may run the experiment multiple times to adjust for this behavior.

### RQ2: Translation Bugs and Fixes:
Please refer to `data/manually_verified_translations` for four projects we complemented AlphaTrans and achieved 100% test pass. The details regarding our manual investigation is available in the paper.

### RQ3: Impact of Test Decomposition
After translating a project, you can execute the following to analyze the effectiveness of test decomposition and producing the raw data in RQ3 figure:

```
bash scripts/analyze_test_decomposition.sh <model_name> <translation_dir>
```

The `<model_name>` can be `gpt-4o-2024-11-20` or `deepseek-coder-33b-instruct`. Similarly, `translation_dir` can be `data/results` or `data/schemas_decomposed_tests/translations` depending on where your translations are saved.

### RQ4: Impact of Test Coverage
Please first refer to [EvoSuite](https://github.com/EvoSuite/evosuite) and use the tool for test generation on all our subject projects, and store them under `java_projects/cleaned_final_projects_evosuite`. We used the default values provided by the tool to generate tests. Then, please refer to steps in [Translate New Java Projects](#translate-new-java-projects) to translate EvoSuite tests. Note that these tests are no different from normal fragments, and are not treated differently.

After following the steps for decomposition, coverage extraction, and translating of EvoSuite tests, you can execute the following to get the ATP+ and TPR+ values in RQ4:

```
python3 src/postprocessing/atp_tpr_plus.py --project_name=<project_name>
```

If you face any errors, there might be a problem in translating your EvoSuite tests. Please create an issue with the description of your problem.

### RQ5: Ablation Study

#### Impact of Program Transformation
If you want to investigate the effect of program transformation, please simply follow the steps in [Project Reduction, Program Transformation and Test Decomposition](#project-reduction-program-transformation-and-test-decomposition), and only perform the reduction step. You can then use CodeQL for program analysis and schema creation as mentioned in [Translate New Java Projects](#translate-new-java-projects).

#### Choice of LLM
If you want to merge results of two different models, please first move each model result under `data/results`, and then execute the following:

```
bash scripts/merge_results.sh 0.0 deepseek-coder-33b-instruct gpt-4o-2024-11-20
```

This will merge results and create a new directory under `data/results/{$first_model}_{$second_model}_MERGED`. You can then see the results by running:

```
bash scripts/print_results.sh commons-fileupload 0.0 deepseek-coder-33b-instruct_gpt-4o-2024-11-20_MERGED data/results
```

#### Impact of Program Decomposition
If you want to perform file-by-file translation without program decomposition, please run the following scripts:

```
bash scripts/translate_class_by_class.sh <model_name>
bash scripts/validate_class_by_class.sh <model_name>
```

The project name can be either `deepseek-coder-33b-instruct` or `gpt-4o-2024-11-20`.

## Translate New Java Projects
In this section, we discuss how to add more projects and translate with AlphaTrans. Below, we provide the steps for the ten subject projects in our work. If you add a new project, it should be similar to existing ones. For every project, we provide two specific snapshots as shown below:

1. [`original_projects`](/java_projects/original_projects): Original snapshot of the projects cloned from GitHub.
2. [`cleaned_final_projects_decomposed_tests`](/java_projects/cleaned_final_projects_decomposed_tests/): Snapshot of the `original_projects` with third-party libraries removed, overload methods/constructors transformed, and tests decomposed.

You can start experimenting from the second snapshot (`cleaned_final_projects_decomposed_tests`) as project reduction, transformation, and decomposition can potentially take hours. Please refer to [Project Reduction, Program Transformation and Test Decomposition](#project-reduction-program-transformation-and-test-decomposition) for further preprocessing steps.

### 1. CodeQL Database Creation & Static Analysis

AlphaTrans requires [CodeQL CLI](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/codeql-cli/getting-started-with-the-codeql-cli/setting-up-the-codeql-cli) for database creation and static analysis of projects. We already install CodeQL using Docker. We also clone the [vscode-codeql-starter](https://github.com/github/vscode-codeql-starter) repository required for executing CodeQL queries. Please follow the steps below to create project database and execute queries on [`cleaned_final_projects_decomposed_tests`](/java_projects/cleaned_final_projects_decomposed_tests/):

#### Create CodeQL Project Database
Create project database with CodeQL by executing the following script:
```
bash scripts/create_database.sh _decomposed_tests
```
After successful execution, the databases should be created under `databases/<project_name>_decomposed_tests`.

#### Execute CodeQL Queries
We have already copied all CodeQL files from [`queries`](/queries/) into the `vscode-codeql-starter/codeql-custom-queries-java` directory. Execute the following to run all necessary CodeQL queries:
```
cd vscode-codeql-starter/codeql-custom-queries-java
bash run.sh
```
Once all queries are executed, query outputs will be stored under `data/query_outputs_decomposed_tests`.

### 2. Program Decomposition

Execute the following to decompose programs and create project schemas:
```
bash scripts/create_schema.sh _decomposed_tests
bash scripts/extract_call_graph.sh _decomposed_tests
```
These scripts will properly store project schemas in JSON format under `data/schemas_decomposed_tests`.

### 3. Type Translation
We provide our universal type map under [`data/type_resolution/universal_type_map_final.json`](/data/type_resolution/universal_type_map_final.json). This type map can be directly used, however, if you want to translate types again, please execute the following from the root directory of the repository to perform type translation on the projects.

```
bash scripts/extract_types.sh _decomposed_tests
bash scripts/crawl_type_desc.sh
bash scripts/translate_types.sh <type> <model_name>
```

The `<type>` can be either `simple` or `source_description`. The former prompts the model with vanilla prompt, while the latter prompts the model with source PL type description. The model can be either `deepseek-coder-33b-instruct` or `gpt-4o-2024-11-20`.

### 4. Skeleton Construction
Execute the following from the root directory of the repository to generate skeletons of projects and check their syntactical correctness

```bash
bash scripts/get_dependencies.sh _decomposed_tests
bash scripts/create_skeleton.sh _decomposed_tests
```

This command should create proper skeletons in target language under `data/skeletons/<project_name>`.

### 5. Compositional Translation and Validation

Finally, execute the following from the root directory of the repository to perform compositional translation and validation on the projects.

```bash
bash scripts/generate_test_invocation_map.sh _decomposed_tests
bash scripts/extract_coverage.sh <project_name> _decomposed_tests
bash scripts/translate_fragment.sh <project_name> <temperature> <model>
```

You can use `project_name=commons-fileupload`, `temperature=0.0`, and `model=gpt-4o-2024-11-20` as an example.

## Project Reduction, Program Transformation and Test Decomposition
In this section, we provide the steps on how to get rid of third-party libraries from original projects, transform programs and perform test decomposition.

### 1. Project Reduction

#### Add the Maven JAR Plugin

Run the following script to add the `maven-jar-plugin` to a project for a test jar:
```
bash scripts/add_plugin.sh <project_name>
```

#### Build and Merge Source and Test JARs
Run this script to build the project and merge the source and test JARs:
```
bash scripts/merge_jar.sh <project_name>
```
> [!NOTE]
> If a project uses an older version of Java, please consider changing the `pom.xml` file or use `-Dmaven.compiler.source=1.8 -Dmaven.compiler.target=1.8` flags to override the compiler versions during compilation.

#### Generate a Call Graph

Generate a simple call graph (via JavaCG) of the entire project using the merged JAR:
```
bash scripts/generate_cg.sh <project_name>
```

#### Reduce Project
```
python3 src/preprocessing/reduce_third_party_libs.py <project_name>
```
The project name is the name of a directory from `java_projects/original_projects`. After reduction, a directory of the same name will appear under `java_projects/automated_reduced_projects/`.

### 2. Program Transformation

Before doing program transformation, please follow the steps mentioned in [CodeQL Database Creation and Static Analysis](#1-codeql-database-creation--static-analysis) to properly create databases of reduced projects, generate query outputs and store them under `data/query_outputs/`. Then, execute the following to perform method transformation on a specific project. This script will assume project reduction has been done properly, since it attempts to perform method transformation on projects under `java_projects/automated_reduced_projects/`.

```
bash scripts/method_transformation.sh <project_name>
```

After method transformation, the tool creates a version of project with transformed methods under `java_projects/preprocessed_0/`. At this point, you need to create databases again and generate new query outputs to perform constructor transformation. Please make sure your query outputs are stored under `data/query_outputs/`. You can then execute the following to perform constructor transformation:

```
bash scripts/constructor_transformation.sh <project_name>
```

After successful execution, the tool creates a version of project with transformed constructors under `java_projects/cleaned_final_projects/`.

> [!NOTE]
> Due to limitations in the static analysis tool, some rare method/constructor transformations might need additional human investigation. To avoid this investigation, we provide a version of the transformed projects under `java_projects/cleaned_final_projects_decomposed_tests`. We aim at releasing the next version of the tool to completely resolve this issue with a better static analysis tool. If you still want to transform projects, please fix these few issues under `java_projects/cleaned_final_projects/` and achieve all test pass with maven.

### 3. Test Decomposition
AlphaTrans performs test decomposition on transformed projects as a step to address the long-call chain problem when executing tests in target language. Please execute the following to first extract executed tests and their coverage, and use this information to decompose tests properly:
```
bash scripts/extract_coverage.sh <project_name> ''
```
Once this executes properly, it should create a directory called `source_test_execution` under [`data`](/data/). Then execute the following to decompose tests:
```
bash scripts/decompose_test.sh
```
After successful execution, this should create the [`cleaned_final_projects_decomposed_tests`](/java_projects/cleaned_final_projects_decomposed_tests/) directory under [`java_projects`](/java_projects/).

> [!NOTE]
> There might be a need to do some small manual changes after test decomposition. For instance removing `@Test(expected = IllegalArgumentException.class)` from test annotation as we do not know ahead of time which decomposed tests throw exception. Please refer to our reference decomposed tests (e.g., [`cleaned_final_projects_decomposed_tests`](/java_projects/cleaned_final_projects_decomposed_tests/)) for specific examples. A project with decomposed tests is considered ok as long as it can be compiled by maven.
